1) How to disable respawning of all heroes?

GameRules:SetHeroRespawnEnabled(false)

This can be placed anywhere in your gamemode code.

2) How to disable respawning for an individual hero (not all heroes)?

hero:SetRespawnsDisabled(true) worked without issues before Aghanim's Lab 2. 
Changing this causes top bar icon (grayed-out hero icon while dead) for the hero shows him as permanently dead until he dies and respawns again if respawn is enabled again.

Workaround if the thing above bothers you: 
- If a hero isn't supposed to respawn, put an extremely large respawn time when the hero dies.
How to do it? Listen to entity_killed event and then:

if condition then
  if not killed_hero:IsReincarnating() then
    killed_hero:SetTimeUntilRespawn(999999)
  end
end

3) How to make the shops global (being able to buy items from anywhere on the map)?

First: GameRules:SetUseUniversalShopMode(true) -- this will allow buying secret shop items in the fountain shop and all items in the secret shop.
Second: In Hammer, find the fountain shop trigger box and expand it all over the map. One trigger box is enough if you did the first thing.
